# NetworkX
### NPTEL - Discrete Mathematics

> NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
> NetworkX provides:
> - tools for the study of the structure and dynamics of social, biological, and infrastructure networks;
> - a standard programming interface and graph implementation that is suitable for many applications;
> - a rapid development environment for collaborative, multidisciplinary projects;
> - an interface to existing numerical algorithms and code written in C, C++, and FORTRAN; and
> - the ability to painlessly work with large nonstandard data sets.
>
> With NetworkX you can load and store networks in standard and nonstandard data formats, generate many types of random and classic networks, analyze network structure, > build network models, design new network algorithms, draw networks, and much more.
